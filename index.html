                    Hello, my name is Chris. Welcome to my portfolio site. I would consider my design style to be
                    compact, symmetrical, and clean. I have taken a heavy influence from vintage soda and engine oil
                    branding. I really enjoy laying out typography as well as manipulating shapes to create lettermarks.
                    This interest in design goes all the way back to elementary school when I would draw sports logos all over my homework. I put more effort into my drawings than the long division problems. <br>
                    <br>My other interests include; discovering new music, attending boxing classes, playing basketball, eating good food, and being outdoors.
                    I enjoy meeting new people, but avoid being too caught up in social media such as, Facebook and Twitter, so if your looking to connect, shoot me an email or find me on LinkedIn.
                    
                </p>
